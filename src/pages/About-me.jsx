        <p>I am a single father of a wonderful 6 year old daughter. Our time together is
          precious, whether it's at a city park or visiting 
          with family. Between events with her, I also enjoy 
          learning new things.

          I earned  my bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota, 
          Morris in 2018. I spent the next 5 years worker as a chemical technician.
         After spending five years in the field, I felt the need for a change 
         and decided to pursue a career in coding. I have always been drawn to
         computers and almost chose a major of computer science. I am thankful 
         to have the opportunity to delve into the world of coding.

          Currently, I'm fully immersed in a challenging bootcamp program.
          I am near the end of the program and feel that I have done well.
          Looking forward, it is clear that this is a journey in which there
          seems to be no end. There will always be something new to learn and 
          that is what makes this career field so exciting.

          The coursework in which I have experience is GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery,
          Bootstrap, Tailwind, Node.js, Express, React, RESTful API, MySQL, MongoBD. As 
          well as concepts such as routing, object-relational mapping, and model-view-controller.
          With the introduction and implementation of these topics, I feel 
          that I am prepared to begin my career in development.
