# React Portfolio

## Description

React Portfolio is a front-end app meant to be the first version of what is to become my professional portfolio page. Currently, it features the fundamental functionality of futre version. However, this is still an early version and there is more work to be done. While this project has been a great asset for learning React, it could still use more styling, which includes a professional avatar.

## Installation

Installation is not necessary since this has been deployed as a web page.

## Usage

The portfolio has 4 main sections: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume. The about me section is as it sounds. The portfolio page has 6 different projects that I have worked on as part of a team of alone. Each picture is a link to another page breaking down the tech stack of each product. On the bottom of each picture block are links to the GitHub repo for each project, and if deployed a link to the deployed application.
